## About Me

I’m an experienced technology leader with a background spanning architecture and engineering. Over the past 20+ years, I’ve designed, scaled, and modernised cloud-native platforms across web, mobile, data, and AI. I lead with a focus on clarity, trust, and outcomes, balancing hands-on technical depth with a strong sense of how to support people and drive strategy.  

I care about solving real business problems with well-considered, durable solutions, and building teams that are confident, capable, and ready for what’s next.
